## 🔬 **2. Technical Architecture**

### **2.1 Core Innovation: Frequency-Based Resonance**

The fundamental breakthrough of RML lies in its **frequency-based resonant architecture**:

```
Traditional LLM Architecture:
Input → Tokenization → Attention → Feed-Forward → Output

RML Architecture:
Input → Frequency Encoding → Resonance Matching → Pattern Recall → Output
```

#### **2.1.1 Frequency Pattern Generation**

RML transforms input information into unique frequency patterns using advanced signal processing techniques:

```python
def generate_frequency_pattern(text, metadata):
    # Convert text to frequency domain representation
    base_frequency = calculate_base_frequency(text)
    
    # Apply resonant encoding based on content type
    if metadata.category == "factual":
        pattern = apply_factual_resonance(base_frequency)
    elif metadata.category == "conceptual":
        pattern = apply_conceptual_resonance(base_frequency)
    
    # Generate unique identifier for instant recall
    return create_resonant_signature(pattern, metadata)
```

#### **2.1.2 Resonance Matching Algorithm**

The core innovation enables instant pattern matching:

```python
def resonant_match(query_pattern, stored_patterns):
    # Frequency domain correlation
    correlation = frequency_correlation(query_pattern, stored_patterns)
    
    # Resonance threshold detection
    if correlation > RESONANCE_THRESHOLD:
        return instant_recall(stored_patterns[correlation])
    
    # Fallback to enhanced search
    return enhanced_semantic_search(query_pattern)
```
